# Energy savings test script

NOTE: this script failed due to the agent being unable to handle its
complexity. The ability to use Gemini 1.5 could make a difference.

1. Create a task called Energy saving to-do.

2. I use a geyser, I drive a car, I watch TV and use internet. Suggest how I
   save energy.

3. Create one task for each item in the list, under the Energy saving to-do
   task.

4. For each task created, add a note containing anything I'd need to think of
   or buy.

5. Give me a full summary of the Energy saving to-do task.
